This lab project will loop through the contents of a directory and try to find .log files.
It will load the log files and try to discover words used in the log file.
It will then generate a word cloud image out of the top 200 mentioned words in your log.

IMPORTANT: Don't run this in a folder where you save your porn. I don't want to be help responsible if your
word cloud has some unsavoury words in it!!!!!

run this code as follows:

python -m playground.berry.lab1.run
